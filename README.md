# ACTL3142 Assignment

Submitted for ACTL3142 - Statistics and Machine Learning for Actuaries. 

Part 1 contains an EDA on COVID related dataset, followed by logistic regression modelling and analysis.
Part 2 contains the creation, validation, and selection of machine learning models for predictive and inference properties, as well as an exploration of the insights from the models. An `xgboost` model was experimented with, trained with racing conditions as further experimental methods of machine learning.

The final report in PDF format are available for both parts, as well as the entirety of the code that was used throughout the project.

Received full marks for boths parts.
